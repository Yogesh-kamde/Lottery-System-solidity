# Lottery-System-solidity

A decentralized lottery system based on blockchain technology and smart contracts.
Lottery is a classical form of entertainment and charity for centuries. Facing the bottleneck of the combination between lottery and information technology, we use smart
contracts and blockchain. We implement Lottery in a blockchain network and show
functioning procedure and security of the proposed lottery system.

With the use of INFURA API and by using GOERLI Testnet we have deployed our Smart Contract through Truffle Suite.
